 1. The project has been challenging to complete because some of the small tasks took a lot of time to understand and then implement. I have been working on this project for the last 2 weeks and it has been exciting because it feels like a real project in real work.
 
2. Following the link will take you to the first page where you can enter the city for which you want to know the weather forecast. After entering the city, the second/main page of the application will be displayed. 
 Here you will find a 24-hour and daily forecast with weather icons. It also shows the time zone and current air conditions, including wind speed, chance of rain, UV index, etc.
 If you want to go back or search for a different location, you can click on the previously entered city name at the top or use the arrow button next to the city name to return to the search input.
